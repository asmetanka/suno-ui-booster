⭐️ Neat square covers everywhere for a consistent look.
⭐️ Polished UI — easier to click, easier on the eyes, less clutter, more focus.
⭐️ Quick and easy to turn on/off.

How It Works & Your Privacy:
✅ To delete songs, the extension securely uses your existing Suno functionality.
✅ To download WAV, the extension uses Suno’s own API with your current session and saves via the browser’s download manager.
✅ Your session information is never stored, saved, or sent anywhere else.
✅ The extension has no tracking, no analytics, and no servers of its own.
✅ It works only on the Suno website.
