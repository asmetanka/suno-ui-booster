# Privacy Policy for Suno UI Booster

**Last Updated:** July 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Suno UI Booster ("the extension") handles information.

**1. No Data Collection**

Suno UI Booster is a purely cosmetic browser extension that enhances the user interface of the Suno.ai website. It operates entirely on the client-side by applying a custom stylesheet (CSS).

The extension **does not** collect, store, transmit, or handle any personal or sensitive user data. It does not use cookies, tracking scripts, analytics, or any form of data collection technology.

**2. Permissions**

The extension requires host permission for the `suno.ai` domain and the `scripting` permission. These permissions are used exclusively to inject the custom CSS styles and for no other purpose.

**3. No External Communication**

Suno UI Booster does not communicate with any external servers. All its functionality is contained within the extension package and runs locally in your browser.

**4. Contact Us**
